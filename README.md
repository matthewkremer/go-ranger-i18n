Internationalization Files for the GO Ranger App

In order to contribute a translation for the app, please copy `en.json` and convert all JSON values to the language you'd like to support! Then either send it to me at matt[at]goranger[dot]app through email, on Twitter @GORangerApp, or in the GO Ranger Discord if you're a member.

Alternatively, submit a pull request!

Please reach out ot @GORangerApp on Twitter before starting work to make sure there are no other people beginning the translation process for your language yet.
